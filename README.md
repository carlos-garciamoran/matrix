## Overview
MATRIX can be deployed at boarding schools as a central management system. Among other functionalities, users can post announcements or reminders in the school's news board. A daily newsletter with that content is sent by default to all users.

Student users can:
- sign-in / sign-out
- make requests for overnight trips

Advisors/Teachers can:
- check their advisee's trip history
- allow / deny overnight trips
- make requests for a leave of absence

Several user roles (e.g. duty advisors, moderators, administrators, etc.) can be assigned to perform privileged tasks.
